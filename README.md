Make sure your machine has GNU Make and python isntalled. Then run the following command:
`

Test CSV files will be generated with 3 different sizes: big, medium and small. Without them test will not be able to be ran.

## Journal
The JOURNAL will contain short description of the obervations from the tests. A more detailed description of the observations will be given in each test category with its own markdown file.

## Additional notes
- Performance will vary from test to test and from machine to machine.
